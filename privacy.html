  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective: November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email and authentication details.</li>

    <li><strong>Post Content (Text & Titles):</strong> The text and titles of posts are
      <strong>encrypted on your device before being uploaded</strong>. We cannot read, view, or access this content.</li>

    <li><strong>Location Coordinates:</strong> Plot stores geographic coordinates to place entries on the map.
      These coordinates are stored in readable form to support map display and search features, and are protected by your authenticated account.</li>

    <li><strong>Photos & Media:</strong> Photos and media files are <strong>encrypted on your device before upload</strong>
      and stored in secure, authenticated storage. Only your device can decrypt them.</li>

    <li><strong>Technical & Diagnostic Data:</strong> We may collect anonymized analytics and crash reports to improve performance.
      This data does not include your encrypted content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. End-to-End Encryption</h2>
  <p>
    Plot uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for your written content and media. Your encryption key is derived from a passphrase that only you know.
    We do not store or have access to this passphrase. As a result:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We <strong>cannot read your notes, titles, or photos.</strong></li>
    <li>Your encryption keys are <strong>never sent to our servers</strong>.</li>
    <li>We cannot decrypt your data, even if requested.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Passphrase and Data Recovery</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not know or store your passphrase, we <strong>cannot recover your encrypted data if you forget it</strong>.
    If your passphrase is lost, your encrypted content may be permanently inaccessible.
  </p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use collected information to provide core app functionality, maintain secure storage, manage subscriptions, and diagnose performance issues.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or trade personal data. Limited third-party services may be used for crash reporting, analytics, and subscription management.
     These services do <strong>not</strong> have access to your encrypted content.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We follow modern security practices and use strong, industry-standard cryptography (including AES-256-GCM).
     However, no system can guarantee absolute protection.</p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Plot is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app.</p>
